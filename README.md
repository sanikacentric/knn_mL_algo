# 🎯 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm in Python — a fundamental supervised learning technique.

## 🎯 Overview

KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their k nearest neighbors in feature space.

## ✨ Key Concepts

- **Distance Metrics** — Euclidean distance for neighbor computation
- - **K Selection** — Choosing optimal k value for classification accuracy
  - - **Lazy Learning** — No explicit training phase, prediction at query time
    - - **Decision Boundaries** — Visualization of classification regions
